                Hello, my name is Robert Carter and I am an Army veteran from the East Coast. While I was in the military, I was a Signal Corps Officer. After I left the service I contracted with the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, both in a logistical capacity. I moved to Washington State from D.C. about 18 months ago and have worked in managerial roles since. I decided to move into coding because it has always been an interest of mine and, through a lot of factors, was denied the opportunity to pursue this career through both the military and government. I hope to take what I learn here and use it to study cyber security, with the overall aim of becoming a white hat.
