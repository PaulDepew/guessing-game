                   My name is Robert Carter.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    I am an Army veteran from the East Coast.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science, and I am halfway through a Master's in Public Policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While I was in the military, I was a Signal Corps Officer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After I left the service I contracted with the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, both in a logistical capacity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I moved to Washington State from D.C. about 18 months ago and have worked in managerial roles since.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I decided to move into coding because it has always been an interest of mine and, through a lot of factors, was denied the opportunity to pursue this career through both the military and government.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I hope to take what I learn here and use it to study cyber security, with the overall aim of becoming a "white hat".
